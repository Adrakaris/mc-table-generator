# MCTableGenerator

*The Minecraft [loot] table generator [which also includes recipes]*

Do you hate having to write loot tables and recipes? Do you hate using *gasp* a GUI? Well here is a pure command line python program that will generate a json file for you, by giving you helpful prompts to fill out.

*Disclaimer: this is not intended for any target audience but me. If you don't like the way it's written, by all means download it and change it yourself. It's not a very convoluted program.*
